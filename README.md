## üñºÔ∏è Corruption Dimensions

To comprehensively evaluate the visual robustness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we categorize 40+ image corruption types into a **three-level taxonomy** based on their formation mechanism: **Global**, **Region**, and **Pixel Level**. This allows us to analyze model sensitivity at multiple operational scales.

### Global-Level Corruptions

These corruptions affect the **entire image** uniformly. They typically change overall image structure, geometry, or tone distribution.

| Category             | Corruption Types                                                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Color Channel**     | Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Invert, GammaContrast, Channel Shuffle     |
| **Geometric Transform** | Scale (x, y, xy), Shear (x, y, xy), Rotate                                   |
| **Blur**              | Defocus Blur, Glass Blur, Zoom Blur, Motion Blur, Gaussian Blur              |
| **Texture Changing**  | Canny Edge, Sharpen, Cartoon                                                  |


### Region-Level Corruptions

These perturbations affect **localized image areas**, simulating real-world scenarios such as occlusion or partial degradation.

| Category             | Corruption Types                                                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Occlusion**         | Cutout, Coarse Dropout                                                        |
| **Compression**       | Average Pooling, Max Pooling, Pixelation, JPEG Compression                   |
| **Weather Condition** | Snow, Frost, Fog, Rain, Snowflake, Spatter                                   |
| **Shape Changing**    | Elastic Transform, Jigsaw, Piecewise Affine                                  |


### Pixel-Level Corruptions

These simulate **low-level noise** often encountered in sensor degradation or transmission errors.

| Category    | Corruption Types                                                       |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Noise**   | Impulse Noise, Shot Noise, Speckle Noise, Gaussian Noise, Poisson Noise |


### Why Corruption Dimensions Matter

- ‚úÖ **Diagnostic Power**: Understand which corruption types most significantly impact model performance.
- ‚úÖ **Sensitivity Tracking**: Reveal per-model vulnerability under different corruptions.
- ‚úÖ **Benchmark Fidelity**: Provide task-level robustness insights relevant to real-world deployment.


## üß† Capability Dimensions

To assess the robustness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) under corrupted visual conditions, we adopt a **hierarchical capability framework** that decomposes model ability into **Perception** and **Reasoning**, each with mid- and low-level subskills.

### Perception Capabilities

| Mid-Level Capability         | Low-Level Skills                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Global Context Sensing**  | Image Topic, Image Quality, Image Emotion, Image Scene, Image Style, Scene Understanding |
| **Instance & Part Recognition** | Instance Identity, Attribute Recognition, Instance Interaction, Instance Attribute, Emotion Recognition, Action Recognition, Celebrity Recognition, Landmark Recognition |
| **Spatial Perception**      | Physical Relation, Instance Location, Instance Counting, Spatial Relation, Object Localization |


### Reasoning Capabilities

| Mid-Level Capability         | Low-Level Skills                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Knowledge Reasoning**     | Chart Understanding, Science Knowledge, Nature Relation, Structured Image-Text Understanding, Visual Mathematics, Function Reasoning, Physical Property Reasoning |
| **Logic Reasoning**         | Visual Reasoning, Visual Referring Expression, Social Relation, Identity Reasoning, Future Prediction, Attribute Comparison, Text Recognition, OCR |


### Why Capability Dimensions Matter

- ‚úÖ **Fine-Grained Analysis**: Goes beyond aggregate accuracy to reveal how specific abilities degrade under corruption.
- ‚úÖ **Model Differentiation**: For example, DeepSeek-VL excels at global context and logic reasoning, while Transcore-M is strong in part-level recognition.
- ‚úÖ **Robustness Diagnosis**: Helps identify which model capabilities are more vulnerable to which types of image corruption (e.g., blur vs. occlusion).
